Hello, I am Ron David, Ololo Ron also works for me.
I trained as a Quantity Surveyor at JKUAT but opted to become a software engineer.
I am interested in machine learning and I just embarked on a new journey to learn everything there is to know about it, taking baby steps, one day at a time.
I am currently learning at the ALX SE program.
And I'm looking forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals, let's pull this off together.
